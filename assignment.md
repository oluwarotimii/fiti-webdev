# Library Borrow System

This project is a small exercise that brings together several basics in JavaScript: variables, objects, loops, conditionals, and functions. The idea is to build a very simple library system that tracks when books are borrowed.

It’s not about writing the “perfect” program. The goal is to practice how each of these pieces fit together.

## What the Program Involves

* An object that represents the library.
* Arrays and objects working together to hold data.
* Loops to repeat tasks like borrowing books several times.
* If/else conditions to check whether a book exists.
* A function that prints a final report.

## Hints to Guide You

* Start by thinking: if you were running a real library, how would you keep track of books and their borrow counts? Try to represent that in JavaScript.
* When a user types in a book name, how will your program know if it’s in the library?
* You’ll need to update the borrow count when a book is found. Where should that update happen?
* The loop should only allow borrowing up to ten times, but is there also a way to let the user stop early?
* At the very end, you need a report that shows all the books and how many times each was borrowed. A single function is a good way to handle this.

If you complete this, you will have practiced most of the building blocks of JavaScript programming: variables, objects, arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions. These same pieces show up in nearly every program you will ever write.
