<!-- Word Problem

A small library is tracking the books borrowed by students.

The library has an object called library that stores:

books → an array of book titles.

borrowed → how many times each book has been borrowed (as another object).

Write a program that does the following:

Prints out all the books in the library.

Lets a user type the name of a book they want to borrow.

If the book exists, increase its borrow count and show a success message.

If it doesn’t exist, show an error message.

Use a loop to allow borrowing up to 3 times.

At the end, use a function called report() that prints out how many times each book was borrowed. -->
